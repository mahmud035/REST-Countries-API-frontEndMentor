## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you to improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, anyone need a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap 5
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- Rest API

### What I learned

I have learned so many things when doing this project. I learned how to toggle dark and light modes in Javascript. Now I feel confident about the ternary operator, sessionStorage, localStorage, Array methods like map(), forEach(), Filter(), find() etc.
